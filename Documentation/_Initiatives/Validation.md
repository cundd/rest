Validation
==========

Extbase provides a flexible [domain model validation](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/book-extbasefluid/master/en-us/9-CrosscuttingConcerns/2-validating-domain-objects.html). 
In contrast to the FLOW implementation validation does not 
take place when the objects are persisted.

The aim of this initiative is to leverage the full power of 
the domain model validation inside your REST webservice.
